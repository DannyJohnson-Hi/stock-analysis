# VBA Challenge

## OVERVIEW OF PROJECT:
Module 2's assignment was about making the macro we built for Steve execute more efficiently. We also modified the macro so that it is more legible and understandable for us in the future or other users.

This Macro can be used to review the Return and Total Daily Volume for the specified Stock Tickers in the years 2017 & 2018.

### RESULTS:
In 2017, the energy market was seeing positive returns across the board, besides for TERP. DQ and SEDG almost reached 200% in Returns so these would have been excellent stocks to dive into in 2017.




---
In 2018, it appears that the market is starting to equal itself back out, with RUN and ENPH still seeing positive returns. These stocks are most likely all negative because of the exponential growth we were seeing from the previous year.

SUMMARY:
# pros: 
A major benifit to refactoring code is the organized structure of the code and being able to execute macros/subroutines in a time saving manor. This will benefit the coder and save time on the clients end, leading to faster analysis of the data.

# cons:

Refactoring code can be time consuming and may lead to you accidentally breaking the code.
